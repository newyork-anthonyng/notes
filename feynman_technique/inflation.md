Inflation is when there is more money in market than there is things to spend it on.

Imagine everyone magically has $100,000 more money. They will be able to buy more things. Companies will run out of stock because people can afford to buy more things. To keep up with the demand, companies will raise prices.

Inflation happens when people can spend money faster than businesses can make things. A little inflation is not bad. It means that the economy is growing.
