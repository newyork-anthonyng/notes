## Seeds of Tactical Destruction
* Loose pieces drop off (LPDO)
	* Unguarded, or inadequately guarded
* Pieces that can be attacked by enemy pieces of lesser value
* One or more pieces than can be attacked via a "discovered attack"
* Weak back rank
* Pinned or "skewerable" pieces along same rank, file, or diagonal
* Pieces (or squares) vulnerable to knight forks
* Overworked pieces
	* Pieces guarding more than one piece or square
* Falling way behind in development
* A large domination of one side's forces in one area of the board
* Pawns nearing promotion
* King uncastled or with little pawn protection, and queens on the board
* Open enemy lines for rooks, queens, and bishops to the king
* Pieces that have little mobility and might easily be trapped if attacked
* Three or more pieces near an enemy king
* A "desperado" piece that is lost anyway and can give itself up for maximum destruction
* Weak squares or pawn structures that cannot be defended
* Threats that can be met in very specific ways
	* Opponent has only 1 or 2 ways to respond to your attack. This essentially gives you a free move

## Appendix
The two most important concepts in chess are safety and activity. Safety is much more important than anything else; and activity is more important than anything but safety.
	Don't drop your pieces. And make sure your pieces are doing something.

Ask yourself, "What can I do to make this work?", rather than with the assumption "I don't think this will work."

## Tactical Guidelines
Teaching how to move the pieces and then basic motifs, without teaching safety and counting, is like teaching someone algrebra before they know arithmetic.

Dont start a fight until your king is safe, especially if your opponent's king is already safe.
