Alexander Khalifman - Evgeny Sveshnikov
1. d4 d5
2. c4 e6
	Queen's Gambit declined.
	
3. Nf3 c6
	White develops a piece.
	Black opens up the a5-d8 diagonal for their Queen. Qa5+ is lingering in the air. Other than this, 4. cxd5 cxd5, and Black maintains 2 center pawns. Without c6, then 4. cxd5 exd5, and White traded a flank pawn for a center pawn.
	
4. g3 Nf6
	White prepares to fianchetto their LSB. 
		
5. Bg2 dxc4
	This is a surprising capture from Black. Black resolves the tension, but gives White 2 center pawns.
		
	Black is opening the position up. This might not be wise. Black's pieces aren't developed, and their King is in the center of the board.

6. O-O b5
	White continues developing. 
	
	Black plays b5 to prop up their c4 pawn. Black is trying to keep this pawn. But this is another pawn move. White has developed their Kingside, while Black has just pushed pawns and developed a single Knight.
	
7. a4 Bb7
	White is putting pressure on Black's Rook with their fianchetto'd bishop. a4 is interesting move.
		7. ...bxa4 8. Qxa4 Bd7 9. Ne5 (putting more pressure on the c6 pawn)
		  -> 9. Qxc4 (leaving Black with an isolated c pawn)
		  
8. Ne5 Qb6
	White threatened:
		9. axb5 cxb5 10. Bxb7
	Black protects their LSB. 
	The Knight is on a good outpost square.
	
9. b3 cxb3
	A very interesting pawn move. These pawn moves aren't things I would ever consider. Is this a minority attack? White has a pawn minority on the Queenside (2 pawns) against Black's pawn majority (4 pawns).
	
	Black gets rid of their doubled c-pawn. It's temporarily a doubled-b pawn, but I expect White to recapture soon enough.
	
10. Qb3 Nbd7
	
11. Be3 c5
	White's DSB is lined up with Black's Queen. White threatens:
	12. d5 Qc7 13. Nxd7 Qxd7 14. dxe6 fxe6 (leaving Black with an isolated e-pawn)

12. Nxd7 Nxd7
13. d5 bxa4
	White traded Knights to prepare the d5 pawn push. 
	
	Is there a tactic after Black's move?
	14. Qxc6 axb6 15. dxe6 Bxg2 16. exd7+ Kxd7 17. Kxg2 (White picks up a piece)
		-> 14. ...Nxb6 15. dxe6 Bxg2 16. exf7+ Kxf7 17. Kxg2 (White wins a pawn. But White's already gambited 2 pawns. They want to keep pieces on the board and attack the King.)
		
14. Qxa4 exd5
	White's Queen pins Black's Knight. 
	
15. Nc3!? d4
	White walks into a pawn-fork. But is this another sacrifice. White could've played Nd2 if they wanted to connect their rooks. But it looks like they wanted to connect their Rooks, AND have an open d-file.
	16. Bf4 dxc3 17. Rfd1

16. Nd5 Bxd5
	This is a far saner move. The Knight moves with tempo. Why did Black take the Knight though. 
	16. ...Qg6 17. Nf4 (Knight is attacking the Queen, and a discovered attack on the Bishop)
	16. ...Qb2 17. Nf6+ Nxf6 18. Bxb7
	Was Black trying to avoid these complications?
	
17. Bxd5 Rd8
	White recaptures with the Bishop and is attacking Black's rook.
	
	Could Black have castled?
	17. ...O-O-O 18. Qa6+ Qxa6 19. Rxa6 (White's attack looks like it fizzles after the Queen trade)

18. Bf4 Qf6
	White moves their Bishop away from pawn attack. 
	
19. Qb5 Bd6??
	What's White trying to do here. Maybe they're moving out of the way of their Rook, to threaten Rxa7. 
	
	If Black can castle, they do have a passed c-pawn.
	
20. Ra6! Rb8
	White pins the DSB. Black counter-attacks White's Queen. 
	
21. Bb7! Bxf4?
	Black allows a Queen capture. Why?
	
22. Rxf6 gxf6

23. gxf4 f5

24. Qc6 Kd8
	White sidesteps the pin. 
	
25. Qd5 Kc7

26. Bc6 0-1
