When it comes to memory, what we already know determines what we're able to learn. 
	When teaching, try to relate new material to things the student already knows.

For experienced members of a field, their work is pattern recognition, rather than reasoned analysis. 

The ability to memorize board positions was best indicator of how good of a chess player they were.

Lower leveled chess players activate the part of their brain that analyzes new information. They are seeing something new.

Great memory isn't the by-product of expertise. It is the essence of expertise.

To get away from your plateau, you need to practice failing. To do this, put yourself in the mind of a master and figure out how that person worked through their problems.
	Benjamin Franklin practiced this technique. He rewrote essays from writers he admired. Then he compared his rewritten essays with the original essay.s
	
Chess players do the same thing. They replay the chess games of masters. They would compare their move to the masters and see where they were different.

Immediate feedkback is needed to improve.
