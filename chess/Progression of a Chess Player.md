> After Chess Steps 1

Chess is a single-player game. I only care about my move. Then the opponent makes their move. Sometimes the opponent attacks or threatens something. But I don't see it because I only care about my moves. I get checkmated by surprise very often.

I stop when I see a decent move. This means I usually keep moving the same piece around.

In the next phase, I still mainly care about my move. But I have started to see what my opponent has done with their previous move. My opponent attacks or threatens something. But I recognize that they're attacking or threatening me. Now, I just hope that I have some way to defend it. My opponent's moves still come as a surprise to me. I still get checkmated. But this time, I see it coming. Most times, I cannot defend against it.

I make the move in my head, and know that I should check my opponent's moves. But my brain is not trained to do that yet. I make the move right away, and then watch as my opponent makes their move. It's still hope chess. The new player might check their opponent's checks, captures, and attacks every 20 moves. As they become more disciplined, they start going through their opponent's checklist every 15 moves. Then 10 moves. They also start to see their rating go up.

Chess is strange. Nowhere else do you want to embrace this cognitive work. We want to take it easy and watch YouTube videos and TikTok videos. With Chess, you're purposefully making yourself very uncomfortable. You're doing so much work voluntarily. But it's addicting. The payoff is to win the game. You prove your mental superiority (in chess) over your opponent.

In the next phase, I start to see the board better. I don't play the first move I see. When you see a good move, look for a better one. I also start to pay close attention to my opponent's moves. I realize I can see into the future. I can predict what moves my opponent will make. I start to realize Chess is a two-player game. But I'm playing both sides. I'm putting my plans against my opponent's plan. It's a battle of thought. But I am also playing as my opponent. I lose because my opponent makes better moves than I made when I imagined myself as the opponent.

I stop having 1 move blunders.

The brain is still not playing through the checklist. Checks, captures, attacks.

The Chess player needs to play more games to improve. They need to gain that vigilance of going through the checklist. It's not a "nice to-have" to do the checklist. This checklist is like looking both ways before crossing the street. If you don't, 9 times out of 10 you'll be okay. But that 10th time, you'll get hit by a car.

The Chess player needs to play games. They need to put their learnings into practice. It's a skill to recognize the existence of a chess tactic during a game. They have to stay vigilant during each chess move! But they also have to take into consideration the chess clock. When doing a chess tactic, you know that an answer exists. You know the tactic is there. But in a chess game, you don't! This is why I like [[Back to Basics, Tactics]]; it contains some puzzles that ask you if there is a win. It also talks about seeds of tactical destruction. If the seeds are there, there may be a tactic. If there isn't, there most likely isn't.

I finished with the Step 2 flashcards. It says that I should be at around 1400 strength! That is quite hard to believe, when my USCF Provisional rating is 800.

I need to supplement this with more chess games. Play more games. I'm starting to play against Excalibur. The computer actually puts up quite a fight at Level 10. I need to start recording my games and analyzing it. I want to get the technique down, but I also want to see what parts of my game can improve.

Improving in tactics. Be more concrete with your calculations. For example, your pawn attacks the opponent's knight. Don't just say "the knight moves somewhere". Look at the concrete moves for the knight. Then visualize the board and see if you can take advantage of the new position.
You need to push your brain to do more work than it's used to. But after awhile, it'll become normal. It's like lifting weights at the gym. When you start lifting 20 lb dumbbells, it's hard work. But after doing it enough, it's easy. This is similar to the 1 move tactics I do. It was very hard when I first learned it. But now my brain automatically plays 1 move tactics in my head. Now, I need to push it to make concrete moves. I need to push it to play until quiesence.

Underdefended pieces are the trademark of tactics.

Beginner players look at the direct consequences of a move. A knight captures a bishop. More experienced players look at the result of the capture. Lines are opened. Lines are blocked. Pieces are undefended.
