# Notes
You need to find value in what you're learning

There was story of person watching a police cam video. The person marked scenes where the police officer escalated or de-escalated the situation. The person made notes also. At the end of the video, they compared their notes with notes from experts. This is a great way to learn. You're comparing your thought process with those of experts. You can see where your thinking is faulty.

When learning, concentrate on improvement, not performance. This reminds me of focusing on the process, not the results. You don't have full control of the results. But you do have full control of the process. [[Stoicism]]

Teachers shouldn't give answers to students. They should give hints. There's maximum learning when students work hard and find the answers themselves.

To learn, we need to get into a feedback loop. We need to know if we're going the wrong path.

One form of feedback is monitoring. People make notes about what they're learning. They make notes about what mistakes they're making. It gives learners a sense of awareness. [[Learning in chess]]

People need explanations. We need to understand why we're wrong, and correct our thinking.

Getting feedback isn't emotionally great. You're discovering all the places you went wrong. You may start to lose motivation and feel inadequate. It will be a struggle.

To develop a skill, you're going to struggle.

You need to engage with something at least 3 times before you learn it.

To develop a skill, you need to have a good foundation. You need to have a good grasp of the basics.

Retrieval practice was shown to be 50 percent more learning than other forms. It asks students to retrieve information, rather than reconsuming the same information.
	For example, one group was asked to read a passage 4 times. A second group was asked to read it once, and then practice recalling the passage.
This is interesting. But how can this be applied to [[Learning in chess]]? Is this where memorizing games helps?

Retrieving information from our memories is a powerful learning event. Everytime you access the information, you deepen grooves in your brain to make it easier to retrieve in the future.

Except for a few abilities, we can aquire new skills at any time. You can teach an old dog new tricks.

You need to make mistakes to learn. To learn, you need to be at the edge of your comfort zone. By definition, to be at the edge of your comfort zone, you need to make mistakes. [[Learning in chess]] this is why people should play against people stronger than them.
	Purposefully put yourself in situations where you will make mistakes.

Social connections can make learning easier. It gives people emotional resiliance. It's nice to have a support web. [[Learning in chess]] this is what the ChessDojo does well with their Universal Training Program.

You can focus on mastery (improving yourself) or performance (certain outcomes, like winning). You have control over improving yourself; but you have no control over outcomes.

When you focus on performance, you can get easily distracted. When you focus on improvement and mastery, you don't need to prove yourself to others. You're more focused on the task.

You can also learn by mentally doing something. You're deepening the grooves in your brain.

Ask yourself explanatory questions. You'll learn more if you need to explain the topic. [[Learning in chess]] in positions, ask yourself questions? Are there checks, captures, attacks.

When you gather information to support an argument, you're also improving your learning on the subject. You're seeing the subject in a different light.

If people read a text and act it out, you'll retain the information better. [[Learning in chess]]

To learn better, you need to apply your knowledge! You learned the science of cooking, now go and cook.
	[[Learning in chess]] play more games!
	
The protege effect. It's a form of applying your knowledge. You're using your knowledge to teach others about the topic. If you just learned cooking, you can teach others about cooking. This still counts as applying your knowledge, even if you're not actually cooking.

A graphic designer learned more when he went on stackoverflow and answered questions.

Effective learning requires uncertainty. Push yourself to the edge of your comfort zone, where you're uncertain about the answer and will make mistakes.

Ethnic diversity helps learning by making people more skeptical. When you're with a group that is similar to yourself, they fall into groupthink. When you're with people that are not like you, you don't fall into groupthink. You challenge people's ideas.
	Debating a topic is another form of knowledge application.
	
To gain expertise, you need to know patterns. You need to see relationships between different topics.

To learn effectively, find analogues about the topic. Find differences. Find causes. Compare and contrast.

When you see multiple examples of something, you learn it better. You can better understand the general rule that connects the examples.

Vary your practice. This will help with learning

A group of students was asked to describe multiple cases. Another group of students was asked to find the differences between multiple cases. The second group learned better. Trying to think of relationships (compare and contrast, find the difference) will help retain information.

Systemic approach to problem solving
* Understanding
* Devising a plan
* Carrying out the plan
* Looking back

If something is very easy to learn, then it's very easy to forget. You don't put in the necessary work to deepen the grooves.

We have an instinctive brain, which is automatic and fast. We have our deliberative brain, which is slow and analytical. 
You want to actively engage with the content. No distractions. This will help you learn better.

The fact of observing your performance will help you improve.

Feedback doesn't only come from coaches. It can also come from peers. Peers are important too. Sometimes the masters are so far removed from the beginner mindset that they can't relate to you.

Quizzing is another form of evaluation. This is another way where you actively engage with the content.

For spaced repetition, the more the "space" (time between seeing cards), the greater you learn it. You deepen the grooves more effectively.

It's just as important to think about what you're doing, rather than actually doing it. This doesn't necessarily apply to chess, because it's all thinking. The physical act of moving the piece is just an artifact of the game (as compared to hitting a home run in baseball, where you need to combine mental and physical).

Reflecting on your performance, rather than doing more performance trials, give you a much higher rate of learning. [[Learning in chess]] annotate and review your games!
	Di Stefano study with brain teasers.
	
When learning, remove distractions. Even the presence of a cellphone on the desk reduces your ability to concentrate and learn.

People with clear goals (don't lose by time) outperform people with vague goals ("do well")

Learning requires cognitive struggling.
