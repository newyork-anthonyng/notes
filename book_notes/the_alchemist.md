But this isn't the life he wants. Deep down, he knows he wants to travel. Santigao gets the courage to go against his parent's wishes, and tells them he wants to travel. His dad argues, only rich people can travel. The only way people like us can travel is if we're shepherds. Santiago says, I'll be a shepherd then.

Santiago becomes a shepherd and gets to travel. He likes to travel, and actually enjoys working with the sheep. He gets comfortable. One day, he has a dream about finding treasure by the Pyramids. He has this dream again after a couple of months. He visits a fortune teller who tells him to go to the Pyramids and get his treasure.

He also meets a mysterious old man who encourages him to go to the Pyramids. This mysterious man is actually the king of Salem, named Melchizedek. The king says that as you start pursuing your dream, or your "personal legend", the world will conspire to help you.

> This reminds me of the law of attraction. This reminds me more of the cocktail effect. You notice omens that you're looking for.
