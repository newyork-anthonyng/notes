Writing is crucial. Good writers know hot o communicate, whether through code, documentation, or emails.

For all aspects of the project, keep it lean.

Less people. If there are too many people involved, nothing gets done.

Less meetings. If there are too many meetings, nothing gets done.

Less features. It's better to release half a product, rather than a half-assed product.


Choose an enemy. Be the anti-product of the enemy.

In the beginning, don't focus on the details. Get something basic on the screen. The details, like what shade of green to use, or getting the pixel perfect measurements of the button, are unimportant. You can address that in the future. Who knows if you'll even have that button in a month.

Make sure you find the right core audience for your product. Don't try to appease everyone. You'll end up with more features, and a half-assed product. Get your core customers passionate about your product. They'll be great ambassadors for you.

Make your product opinionated. Don't make a product that a lot of people like. Make a product that a small group loves.

When starting to build the app, start with a paper sketch. Keep it rough. Then add HTML and CSS. Then, after this is approved, start coding it for real. Add more fidelity in each step.

Functional specs are not useful. People misinterpret the textual requirements. Build a mock, and let users play with it.

Execution is everything. A great idea means nothing if you can't make it, and make it well.

When designing, make sure to design for:
* blank state (there's no data in app)
* full state (there's data in app)
* error state (something went wrong)

Err on the side of less code. Be critical of any new proposed feature. It will add complexity and bloat to the app.
  As a developer, I've always said we could build whatever the business wanted. But I need to push back on everything. My job isn't to code anything and everything. It's to code the right thing. And to code it well.

Give your proudct a personality. Is it strict? Playful? Funny?

When it's time to launch:
* teaser
* preview
* launch

Your product shouldn't need a manual to use it.
