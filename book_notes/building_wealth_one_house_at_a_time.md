Rule of 72. Take your percentage increase, divide it by 72. That’s how many years it will take to double its value.

Get good financing and good tenants with low operating costs.

Know the neighborhood. Ideally, your first investment property is somewhere you live in.

Page 27

When buying investment property, you’re relying on rental income. Not purely from appreciation. That’s what speculators did that caused the housing bubble. They were looking to quickly flip houses.

Know your market prices and rent

Have some cash in the bank, or know how to get it

Rent to tenants with diversified employment

There’s retail price. And wholesale (discounted price).

Depending on the house, the retail and wholesale percentage can change.

For a cheap house in a bad neighborhood, banks won’t be as willing to give loans. So with less money available, sellers provide a big discount.

For an expensive house in a nice neighborhood, the wholesale price can also be a big percentage. There are fewer buyers in this price range. Sellers will need to provide a big discount to attract offers.

For medium priced houses, the wholesale price is very similar to the retail price. There are more buyers. And financing is available.

Look at national association of realtors report. It shows the amount of inventory, and how long it sat.

Leverage, in layman’s term, is getting the work done from your input multiplied in the output. It’s a multiplicative factor. Think of a see-saw.

Leverage, in finance terms, is using borrowed money for an investment, with the expectation that the investment income will be greater than the interest payments.

Page 75

The amount of your loan payment is dependent on:

- interest rate
- length of loan

Page 76

Who you owe matters. If you take a loan from an investor or a seller (a real person), they will work with you on changing the terms of the loan. They’re interested in getting their money.

However, if you take a loan from a bank, the person you deal with only cares about keeping their job. They might not be as flexible with changing the terms of the loan. 

The main point is that you want to be able to survive market downturns.

Page 77

What does it mean to pay down a loan?

It means to make money payments that are more than the interest. It reduces the amount of principal, and the total interest owed.

The book states that you only benefit from principal pay downs when you sell the house. Why?

Home equity is the fair market value of the house, less any debts associated with it.

Thinks your banker won’t do

1. Make a decision fast enough to loan you money to buy a really good deal
2. Loan you more than 80 percent of the purchase price
3. Make a loan when prices are at their lowest
    1. During a recession, the banks have tight pockets
4. Make a loan without regular monthly payments, or with the first payment due several months from now
5. Loan money to someone who really needs
    1. If you really need it, then you must be in trouble

Rather than refinancing on current house to buy a second one, use the positive cash flow from current house to buy a second one.

Page 97

Don’t ask others to invest with you until you know how to buy at a good price, and can manage it. Build credibility.

Plan to hold property until it doubles in value.
