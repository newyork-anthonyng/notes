The Oakland A’s rethought the game. They challenged basic principals.

They asked, how do teams win baseball games? They score runs. How do they score runs? The conventional wisdom was that the team should have a high batting average. The Oakland A’s challenged this assumption and looked at the data. The data showed that getting on base was the biggest way to win games.

On-base percentage, or OBP, measures how often a player gets on base. Most general managers ignored this statistic, instead looking at superficial statistics like batting average and RBI’s. This meant that some baseball players were wildly over-valued, because they had a high batting average but relatively low OBP. But others were wildly under-valued, because they had a high OBP, but relatively low batting average.

Constraints force innovation. The Oakland A’s were constrained by their low budget. They were forced to innovate. Instead of wallowing in their constraint, Billy Beane, the Oakland A’s general manager, saw this as a challenge.

Scott Hatteberg was a hitter for the Boston Red Sox. His approach to hitting was thoughtful. He wanted to see many pitches, wait for a pitch he likes, and swing away. If Scott didn’t get a pitch he liked, he let it go by for a strike. The Red Sox did not appreciate this approach. They called it selfish. They wanted to him to swing away. But Scott stuck to his process, in the face of management telling him to change.

With pitchers, fans thought that there was no way to find out how to see how good a pitcher was. How could you attribute what work the defense provided, versus what value the pitcher provided? They threw up their hands and gave up. Voros McCracken couldn’t believe this. Instead, he found a way to measure the value of a pitcher, independent of luck and their defense. Voros used the scientific method. He had a hypothesis, he tested it with data, and most importantly, he made experiments to try to refute his conclusions.
